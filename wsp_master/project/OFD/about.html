	<h2>About Us - F.A.Q.</h2>
	
<p>Q. Do you sell used or reburbished beds?</p>

<p id="even">NO! NEVER! All of our bedroom sets and mattresses are 100% brand new, direct from the factory and in original sealed plastic. Bed bugs, mold, dust mites and other unsanitary conditions exist as a result of buying a used mattress. Refurbished beds are also susceptible to these conditions if not properly cleaned and you have no way of knowing that. For what you can buy a new bed for . . . why run the risk??</p>

<p>Q. How come I save so much money buying from you?</p>

<p id="even">We are so glad you asked. We are a Clearance Warehouse and because all items are factory direct we reduce them 40% – 80% below retail. All come with full warranty (up to 15 years depending on brand) and are backed by some of the biggest names in the furniture and mattress industry like Sealy and Simmons.</p>

<p>Q. Can you just deliver the mattress to my home without me trying it?</p>

<p id="even">Regretably we cannot. One person’s firm is another persons soft. Buying a mattress is a personal decision. We ask that you come and try your bed before buying it.</p>

<p>Q. How many beds are on display that I can try?</p>

<p id="even">Unlike other warehouses who have 4-6 beds on display; Our clearance center will have anywhere from 20 – 25 beds on display at any given time. Most sets are displayed in queen size and most are available in all sizes.</p>

<p>Q. Can I buy just the mattress without the box?</p>

<p id="even">YES you can and we are happy to accomodate you in this way. We agree with you; why buy the set if your existing box foundation is in good condition? However, buying the entire set is your best option for many years of restful sleep.</p>

<p>Q. Why is there such a big range in the price of Mattresses?</p>

<p id="even">This is a great question. Price is primarily a function of the quality of the item, materials being used and type of construciton. All beds are made with different types of foams for example. Some manufactureres use 1-2 layers; others use 6 or 7. This is why you have different feel and comfort levels. Foam density and quality is a key factor. Higher priced beds use better quality foams. National brands tend to be higher priced as they invest heavily in advertising and other forms of marketing there by passing this cost on to you in higher prices. That is why you need to try it out. The number one rule in purchasing a mattress is “how it feels to you”. Buy what you like and is comfortable; not what an advertisement says.</p>

<p>Q. Why is there such a big range in the price of Furniture?</p>

<p id="even">Much like mattresses above the price of furniture is based on quality of materials, workmanship, finsihings and overall quality and style of the pieces. Most of our Bedroom Sets and Furniture are made with solid wood and/or hardwoods. They will likely have Dovetail joints and reinforced runners for many years of performance. Lower priced Bedroom sets are made from synthetic materials like particle boad, compressed paper and synthetic veneers. These will perform well but will lack the uniqueness of natural woods both in finishes and performance.</p>

<p>Q. Do your offer layaway?</p>

<p id="even">YES we most certainly do! Just let us know what you need and we will work with you.</p>

<p>Q. How can I pay? What forms of payment do you accept?</p>

<p id="even">We prefer Cash but also accept Debit, VISA, MasterCard and Discover. For our commercial customers, a copy of your tax ID certificate must accompany the sale.</p>

<p>Q. Do your ever sell your display items?</p>

<p id="even">From time to time we do. These are usually sold as “out of the bag” items and come with additional discounts. There is never anything wrong with them; only they were display beds!</p>

<p>Q. Where are you located?</p>

<p id="even">We are conveniently located west of downtown Orlando near John Young Parkway and Silver Star Road. It is easy access from I-4 from the north and south and the 408.</p>
