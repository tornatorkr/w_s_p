	<h2>Site Intent:</h2>
</header>

<div>

	<p>The website for <a href="http://www.orlandofurnituredirect.com/">Orlando Furniture Direct</a> presents prospective customers a selection of name brand factory clearance and closeout furniture.  
	   The original website lacked clear navigation, suffered from poor content organization and it’s design was akin to an obnoxious newspaper insert.  The current website was recently redesigned and has made strides in improving navigation, design refinement (cleaner looking) and responsiveness to multiple viewport sizes.  The intent of this iteration will further refine content organization, site navigation, introduce branding / logo elements and improve user retention, completions and return traffic.  To improve retention, completion and return traffic, a user account login / signup CTA will be added to allow customers to perform various tasks including appointment consultation for design services, product availability, as well as receipt of a weekly newsletter via email featuring current sales promotions.</p>

	<h2>Competitive Analysis:</h2>
</header>

<div>

	<p>Based upon geographic location (Orlando, FL), keyword searches for furniture outlet stores in <a href="http://www.yelp.com/">Yelp.com</a>
	 and available data from <a href="http://www.alexa.com/">Alexa.com</a>, the following competitors have been identified:</p>
	 <p>American Signature Furniture <a href="http://www.americansignaturefurniture.com/">(americansignaturefurniture.com)</a> offers similar merchandise and services and as a national chain, also has a local <a href="http://fl.orlando.asfurniture.com/furniture_store_orlando_fl_409.html/">sub-home page</a>.  It’s corporate home page has better navigation, but feels a bit too busy as there are multiple CTAs competing for one’s attention.  It also lacks mobile-first design responsiveness.</p>
     <p>Aaron's Fine Furniture's <a href="http://www.aaronsfinefurniture.com/">(aaronsfinefurniture.com)</a> website is currently under construction.  As such, no information was available concerning content and organization.  The design of the “under construction” page indicated good use of logo, branding and consistent color palette, but the calligraphy-styled typography was difficult to read at a glance and it’s overuse likely to have an adverse effect on retention, completion and return traffic.</p>
     <p>Rooms To Go <a href="http://www.roomstogo.com/">(roomstogo.com)</a> is also a national chain of furniture stores.  It’s site presents a number of different navigational, browsing and search options without feeling cluttered nor inundating the user with too much information.  The design is clean and visually pleasing, allows online shopping with free delivery and has a CTA featuring free credit financing, but does not employ mobile-first and responsive design concepts.</p>

	<h2>Target Audience:</h2>
</header>

<div>

	<p>Case 1:  A recent college graduate has just landed an entry level position in his field of study, moved out of the parent’s house and into a new empty apartment.  It’s time to leave the cinder-block, 2x8 planks, milk-crate storage, ventilated shelving units and mattress-on-the-floor behind.  While lucky to to be working, it’s still an entry level job and the budget is tight.  The new workforce entrant would like quality furniture for the whole apartment that will not break the bank.</p>
	<p>Case 2:  A family’s consignment store, hand-me-down living and dining room furniture is literally on its last leg.  The rent-a-forever store has a nice selection, but would be worn out and obsolete by the time the payments stop.  They’re looking for a quality, special collection of furniture that wasn’t designed for an ex-super model’s budget.</p>
